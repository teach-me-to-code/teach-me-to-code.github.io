<h1>Sf.js</h1>
<p>I recently went to the Bay Area to visit my brother and got a chance to go to
some meetups and mingle with the local nerdfolk. Here&rsquo;s a summary of the
meetups I attended and what I learned:</p>
<h2 id="electron-meetup">Electron Meetup</h2>
<p>The first meetup was for the exciting new Node.js-based framework
<a href="electron.atom.io">Electron</a>. It lets you build desktop apps in HTML/CSS/JS
and then distribute it to Windows/OS X/Linux. I&rsquo;ve been playing around with
it, so I was excited to hear more about it, especially since two of the
presenters were from Github and part of the Electron team.</p>
<p>The first presentation was a primer on new features added to Electron. The
project only recently hit version 1.0 and it&rsquo;s still under heavy development.
I think for anyone using it in production it&rsquo;s going to be important to keep
track of development and the direction the team goes.</p>
<p>Next we had a demo of building an Electron app to send commands to a robot.
All the serious code was handled by pre-existing Node.js plug-ins, but it was
a fun demo (showing off the
<a href="http://store.sphero.com/products/bb-8-by-sphero">Sphero BB-8 robot</a>), and
shows how easy it is to quickly build a desktop GUI app using Node.js
packages.</p>
<p>The most interesting presentation from a technological perspective was
from a member of the <a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a> team, showing off their new
project <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron-compile">Electron-Compile</a>.
It&rsquo;s a way to simplify the transpilation of source code into HTML/CSS/JS
during development of an Electron app. Much time was spent demonstrating
the cleverness of the team in achieving this, which I can&rsquo;t reproduce here.
It was most impressive, and definitely something I will look into using for
my next Electron project.</p>
<p>And finally, the most entertaining presentation from the presenter with the
most flair, <a href="https://twitter.com/rauchg">Guillermo Rauch</a> basically showed
off his nifty new Electron-based terminal emulator,
<a href="https://github.com/zeit/hyper">Hyper.app</a> (until a recent cease &amp; desist
known as HyperTerm). I didn&rsquo;t really learn much knew, as I was already
familiar with the project, but I was dazzled by the things he could do with
it. I highly recommend checking out Hyper.app and playing around with it.
I would describe it as the <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> of terminal emulators.</p>
<h2 id="typescript">TypeScript</h2>
<p>My next meetup was at Google&rsquo;s SF Headquarters to learn about TypeScript,
last year&rsquo;s hot new language to transpile to JavaScript that I haven&rsquo;t heard
much on since. I have a lot less to say about this presentation, as it it
simply wasn&rsquo;t as interesting. The main thing that I learned from it is that,
contrary to what I&rsquo;d heard before, the main advantage of TypeScript is not
avoiding type errors at runtime but actually to allow for better tooling
(specifically better IntelliSense code-completion in Visual Studio/VS Code).
It makes sense now why Microsoft would create and push TypeScript, as it
seems well married to their text editors.</p>
<h2 id="nodeschool-sf">NodeSchool SF</h2>
<p>Finally, while not a true meetup, I attended
<a href="http://nodeschool.io">NodeSchool</a> SF, an open workshop for learning more
about Node.js. I attended a special workshop there on contributing to the
Node.js core codebase. There, I found that I had a little trouble actually
Node.js from source because on my Arch Linux installation Python 3 is named
simply <code>python</code>, and the Node.js make files expect Python 2. I finally got
around this by temporarily symlinking <code>python2</code> to <code>python</code> and overriding my
usual <code>$PATH</code>. After getting it compiled, my first commit to the Node.js
project was <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/7f7502d901e8eb9db5213121a6b0a9d4f825d23c">a modification to the documentation regarding building it</a>.
Just getting my feet wet, to be sure, but a satisfying feeling.</p>
