      <description>After 6 years at Google, I resigned this past March.
Rather than explaining why I left, I think it&amp;rsquo;s easier to explain why I stayed as long as I did. To begin with, I never aspired to work at a big tech company. Because I don&amp;rsquo;t have any formal computer science education, I assumed that big tech companies would never hire me. Once I was hired by Google, I saw it as a big experiment.</description>
