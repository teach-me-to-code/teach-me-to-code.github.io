      <description>I recently went to the Bay Area to visit my brother and got a chance to go to some meetups and mingle with the local nerdfolk. Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of the meetups I attended and what I learned:
Electron Meetup The first meetup was for the exciting new Node.js-based framework Electron. It lets you build desktop apps in HTML/CSS/JS and then distribute it to Windows/OS X/Linux. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with it, so I was excited to hear more about it, especially since two of the presenters were from Github and part of the Electron team.</description>
